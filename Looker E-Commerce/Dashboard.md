🔍 Departmental Insights & Recommendations

💰 Sales Insights

Q4 is consistently the highest performing quarter from 2019 to 2025, driven by holiday promotions.

High-performing brands: Levi’s, Calvin Klein, and Nike drive over 35% of annual revenue.

Some regions underperform due to lower repeat purchase rates.

Recommendations:

Expand Q4 promotion planning to Q3 to maximize conversion.

Boost loyalty program for low-retention areas.

Focus on bundling strategies with top 3 brands.

📣 Marketing Insights

Organic traffic is the top source, but paid campaigns drive higher conversion.

Mobile users account for over 60% of sessions but convert less than desktop users.

Traffic spikes align with influencer campaigns and product launches.

Recommendations:

Optimize landing pages for mobile.

Invest more in high-ROI influencer and paid search campaigns.

Analyze campaign timing to avoid overlapping traffic noise.

🎧 Customer Service Insights

Support tickets peaked during product launches and delays in Q4.

Average resolution time improved by 25% from 2022 to 2025.

High satisfaction scores (>90%) for live chat, low for email.

Recommendations:

Prioritize live chat as primary channel.

Expand self-service knowledge base for common issues.

Anticipate support needs ahead of product drops.

📦 Inventory Insights

Overstocking in apparel leads to aging inventory (90+ days).

Inventory turnover is lowest in Q1 and Q2 of each year.

Distribution imbalance causes stockouts in high-demand locations.

Recommendations:

Reallocate inventory dynamically based on sales heatmap.

Introduce aging alerts and markdown automation.

Improve forecasting with seasonality and marketing event data.

🚚 Logistics Insights

Delivery SLA missed during Q4 surge in 2022 and 2023.

Some distribution centers underperform due to longer shipping routes.

On-time delivery rate improved in 2025 due to new 3PL integration.

Recommendations:

Balance delivery load across regional centers.

Expand partnerships with reliable 3PL carriers.

Implement predictive logistics for peak planning.
